# Titanic-survivors-analysis
I analyze a dataset of Titanic accident survivors and communicate my findings about it. 
The Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib are used to make the analysis easier.<br>
In this project, you will go through the entire process so that you know how all the pieces fit together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process. In this project, you will also gain experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easie
