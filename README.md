# Titanic-survivors-analysis
I analyze a dataset of Titanic accident survivors and communicate my findings about it. <br>
I go through the entire process of a typical data analysis, as well as the experience using the Python libraries NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier.<br>
Please check the ipynb file for my findings about this accident.
